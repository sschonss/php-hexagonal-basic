# Hexagonal Architecture in PHP

This is a simple example of how to implement the hexagonal architecture in PHP.
The main goal of this project is to show how to separate the business logic from the infrastructure.

Inside the code, you will find snippets of code that show how to implement the hexagonal architecture in PHP.

The snippets are in portuguese, but I will translate them to English in the future.
